We need to decide the functionality of our device. 
For simplicity, I suggest the device has several modes that the user can choose from.
Lets say that the device has 3 sensor inputs.

Mode 1) Continuous Play - works most like an actual theremin 
new note commands are sent whenever the pitch sensor crosses a pitch change threshold
mapping...
Sensor1: Pitch
Sensor2: Velocity (volume)
Sensor3: Modulation (some Control Change parameter)

Mode 2) Gated Play - notes are not played all the time, but they do have a constant volume
new notes commands are sent whenever the gate threshold is crossed (the hand gets near enough)
mapping...
Sensor1: Pitch
Sensor2: Gate Threshold
Sensor3: Modulation (some Control Change parameter)

Mode 3) Parameter control - this mode would be to stricly change parameters of 
a synthesizer but not trigger any new nots to be played. 
mapping..
Sensor1: Control Change xx 
sensor2: control change xx
sensor3: control change xx

if we had strict modes like this, we could simply have a momentary push button to cycled through the different modes
and some indicator to show the user which mode they are in. 

a user may want more control ability,
Things to consider...

might want dedicated encoders or pots to control...

1) SPAN: like being able to choose the span of the notes associated with proximity.
for example, does 1 foot of proximity change correspond to 2 octaves?

2) RESTING NOTE: Where does the keyboard start, is middle C the lowest note?
